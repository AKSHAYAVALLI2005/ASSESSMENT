#Question 1
touch file1
chmod 777 file1

touch file1 creates an empty file.
chmod 777 file1 gives read, write, and execute permission to:
        User
        Group
        Others

#Question 2
touch file2
chmod 777 file2
chmod g-w file2

Initially full permissions are given for clarity.
chmod g-w file2 removes only the write permission from the group.
User and others permissions remain unchanged.

#Question 3
mkdir -p dir1/dir2
cd dir1/dir2
touch file3
cd ..
ln -s dir2/file3 file_softlink

mkdir -p creates nested directories.
file3 is created inside dir1/dir2.
A soft link named file_softlink is created inside dir1 pointing to dir2/file3.

#Question 4
ps aux

Displays all running processes with:
        User
        PID
        CPU and memory usage
        Command details

#Question 5
mkdir dir1
cd dir1
touch file1 file2 file3
ls -lt >> file_details 

    dir1 directory is created.
    Three files are created inside it.
    ls -lt lists files sorted by timestamp.
    Output is redirected to file_details.
